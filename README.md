# Introduction
This is the supplementary material for an extensive production data set for a five-axis CNC milling process which can be found at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14094886). Three geometrically different products were manufactured and production data from the machine was recorded. The recorded manufacturing process contains the preparation of the machine for the next product (changeover) as well as the machining process (production). An experimental manufacturing was organized with the aid of a changeover matrix to ensure that all possible changeover combinations for the three products were considered. The production was repeated five times, resulting in 30 manufacturing sessions and five complete changeover matrices. The data set was recorded from a Siemens 840D-SL machine control on a five-axis milling machine tool of type "Spinner U5-620" in a laboratory environment. A rich feature set is provided including rich supplementary material i.e. the NC-codes of the products, tool information, and a Jupyter notebook to illustrate the usage of the dataset.
